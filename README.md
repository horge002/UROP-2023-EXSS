# UROP-2023-EXSS---MATLAB-code
Code developed during undergraduate summer research project in Experimental Solid State Group at Imperial supervised by Dr Julie Euvrard. Code was used to control multiple instruments with GPIB interface for electrical characterisation measurements.

GPIB_control.m = code which uses device dependent commands in MATLAB to control current and voltage measurements on a source-measure unit and plots the experimental data for 2 point probe conductivity measurements.

SMU_DMM_combined_control.m = code which uses SCPI and device dependent commands in MATLABto control a digital multimeter and source-measure unit together for 4 point probe conductivity measurements.
